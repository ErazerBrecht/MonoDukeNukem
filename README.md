# Mono Duke Nukem
C# Monogame Platform Game

A project I made for a univeristy project.
The goal was to make a platform game in C#.

I chose for Duke Nukem. The original game was made in 1992.


It has jumping, screen scrolling, shooting and many more.
I share the code for education purposes. 

The sprites aren't my property. They do belong to the makers of Duke Nukem!!!
